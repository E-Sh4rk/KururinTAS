----------

Physics of helirin: similar to wall collisions.

Default rate = -Default rate  if at least one spring touch the good semi-helirin (depending on current default rate and spring direction)
(Collisions at radius 0 (ie center) do not count)
Each spring is counted at most 1 time.
/!\ Depends on the order at which springs/collision_points are treated!
Priority at negative radius, then positive radius, then 0.

Bump:
65536, direction of the bumper (applied immediatly)
If many spring touch: cumulate the effects of position bump!

Angle rate:
768, direction of the new sleep rate (not applied this frame) (- by default)
Only if collision at radius != 0.

It seems to takes place BEFORE the effects of wall physics
BUT modification of rotation rate direction and position does not influence wall physics.

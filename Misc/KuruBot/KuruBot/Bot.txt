----- STATE REDUCTION -----

XPos/YPos: round to 1/64e pixel
XBump/YBump: round to 1/64e pixel/frame
Rot: round to *default frame offset*=182
Rot rate: round to *default frame offset*/frame=182
RotSleepRate: no need for reduction (only two values reachable)

Precision could be proportionnal to the "distance to a wall".

----- FORBIDDEN PATHS / PARAMETERS -----

Max Frames: Only search paths under a certain number of frames
Search Bounds: Refuse states out of these bounds
Max Moves: Only search paths that change inputs less than a fixed number of times
Frame resolution: Refuse paths that change inputs two times in less than a fixed number of frames

----- COST FUNCTION (for A*) -----

We could build a map of cost (for each position pixel), with a flooding algorithm that only consider position.
Flooding could get a little constant bonus when infiltrating into walls, and a little constant malus when leaving a wall.
It could propagate inside walls (maybe at the same speed than on ground, because it can't stay into wall forever due to lives).
(/!\ result will not be optimal)

Bonus for infiltrating walls decrease when the player loose a life (or more preceisely, when the player spend invicibility time):
at least one cost map per heart should be generated, the last one (1 heart) disallowing wall clip.

----- STATE REDUCTION -----

XPos/YPos: round to 1/64e pixel
XBump/YBump: round to 1/64e pixel/frame
Rot: round to *default frame offset*
Rot rate: round to *default frame offset*/frame
RotSleepRate: boolean value actually

----- FORBIDDEN PATHS / PARAMETERS -----

Max Frames: Only search paths under a certain number of frames
Search Bounds: Refuse states out of these bounds
Max Moves: Only search paths that change inputs less than a fixed number of times
Frame resolution: Refuse paths that change inputs two times in less than a fixed number of frames

----- WEIGHTS & COST FUNCTION (for A*) -----

We could add a cost function *euclidian distance*/*max speed*
Weight of edges could be greater when inputs change from last move (like 2 instead of 1)

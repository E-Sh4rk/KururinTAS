# KuruBot

## Instructions

### Prerequisite

- This bot has been designed for Windows, but it might also work on Linux or Mac.
- For Windows systems, .NET Framework 4 (or more) need to be installed. For Linux or Mac, Mono can be used as an alternative.
- This bot does not need to communicate with the game in order to work. However, we recommend to connect it to Bizhawks in order to easily transfer configurations and visualize solutions.

### Connecting the bot to Bizhawk

1. Place the script `kuruCOM.lua` in a folder with r/w permissions.
2. Start Kuru Kuru Kururin in Bizhawks and load this LUA script.
3. Connect the bot by clicking on the `Connect` button and selecting the LUA script (the same file that was loaded by Bizhawks, not a copy).
4. If the game is paused in Bizhawks, the communication will also be paused. In this case, you can advance a frame if you want to complete a pending transfer.
